## ❓ FAQ

#### How is strength calculated?
Uses entropy (bits), not just length or checked boxes. Real security rates and character variety are considered.

#### Will you see or store my passwords?
Never. Everything runs in your own browser; your passwords never leave your computer.

#### Can I use this on my phone/tablet?
Yes – the site is fully responsive and touch-friendly!

#### Can I contribute or suggest features?
Pull requests and ideas are always welcome! See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ishaansucksatlife/Secure-Password-Generator/issues) or reach out below.
